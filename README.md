## Introduction
Briefly describe the AI Robotics course, its objectives, and what knowledge or skills students are expected to gain.

## Lab Assignments
Each lab assignment is documented in its own directory with a README. Below is a brief overview of each lab.

### Lab 1: Setup and Introduction to ROS
- **Objective**: The purpose of this lab is to get the ROS system installed and working. 
- **Methodology**: Use ROS basic methods, subscriber to do it. 
- **[More Details](Lab1/lab1.md)**

### Lab 2: 3D Obstacle Detection from Point Clouds
- **Objective**: Understand and process 3D cloud with ROS.
- **Methodology**: Use ROS method to process 3D point cloud, object detection use different filtering algorithm.
- **[More Details](Lab2/lab2.md)**

### Lab 3: Pathfinding Algorithms in Robotics
- **Objective**: Implement and compare different search algorithms, including A* Search, Greedy Best-first Search, and Uniform Cost Search, across various map environments
- **Methodology**: Implement in ROS and visualize the robot simulation in world map.
- **[More Details](Lab3/lab3.md)**

### Lab 4: Navigating with Potential Fields
- **Objective**: Understand and implement robot navigation using potential fields.
- **Methodology**: Implement in ROS and visulize potential field effect in world map simulation.
- **[More Details](Lab4/lab4.md)**
